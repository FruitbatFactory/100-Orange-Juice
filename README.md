This is the official bug tracker for 100% Orange Juice on GitHub, please use it to check for known issues (and their related information) or report your own issues, if you so desire. You can still use whatever other means (E-mail, Steam, Discord to report issues about the game), use whatever is easier for you.

Please respect the issue templates, and try to write your report in English. If English isn't your native language and you aren't comfortable using it, please include a machine translation to English together with a copy of your report in your native language; we may use it to understand the situation better.

### How to report an issue

- Before anything, make sure your system and drivers are properly updated. Please understand that if you are using, for example, a version of your operating system that isn't supported anymore, it could make figuring out some issues more complicated. But don't feel pressed to update if you have a reason; we will try our best to check your case.
- Follow the information that will be asked by the **New Issue** Template to the best of your effort.
- When answering existing issues, keep the conversation within the theme. If you have an unrelated issue that may be pertinent, please report it separately and link it in a message stating your reasoning for thinking so.
